# scorched_earth_study
pygame demo project to give easy (and I hope interesting) tasks to my son.

## Known issues

* Check the TODOs in the code :-)
* I messed up somewhere how I count the x pos of the tank, check that
* Number of tanks is hardcoded
* The terrain blocks are not destroyed or collapses after an explosion
* The tank doesn't fall to lower terrain if the blocks are destroyed under it (see heightmap)
* I added some menu items which would be fun to implement, like:
  * select different gravity
  * add random wind, and display it on the screen
  * add random edge behaviour, like the bullet appears on the other side or just bouncing back
* Add different weapons/bullets.
